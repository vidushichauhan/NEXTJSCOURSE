Welcome to my repository for the Next.js course projects! This repository contains all the projects that I have completed as part of the Next.js course, covering both the "Pages Router" and the new "App Router".

## Introduction

I am excited to share a significant update to the Next.js course! This update includes a brand-new section that dives deep into the Next.js "App Router". The "App Router" offers an alternative approach to building Next.js applications, complementing the existing "Pages Router" method. 

The new section covers:
- Routing
- Pages
- Layouts
- React Server Components
- Server Actions
- File Uploads
- And much more!

This section is added right after the "React Refresher" section. You can jump directly to it using this [link](#).

## Course Overview

The course now includes both the "Pages Router" and the "App Router" approaches, providing a comprehensive understanding of Next.js. The "App Router" is the latest and is likely the future of Next.js, although the "Pages Router" remains a stable and widely used method.

### Course Structure

1. **React Refresher**
2. **NextJS Essentials (App Router)**
3. **Routing & Rendering**
4. **Data Fetching**
5. **Data Mutation**
6. **Caching**
7. **Optimizations**
8. **Authentication**
9. **Pages Router**

### Note on Legacy Content

The old content, particularly from the "React Refresher" section, is still available but will be removed in the future. For now, it is separated by a lecture titled "IMPORTANT -- LEGACY CONTENT BELOW".


```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nextjs-course-projects.git
cd nextjs-course-projects
```

## Usage

To run any of the projects, navigate to the project directory and start the development server:

```bash
cd project-directory
npm install
npm run dev
```

Each project has its own `README.md` with detailed usage instructions.
